# PacMan Array With Edge Detection ![PacMan still](images/PacMan 1.png)
## Description
In order to code PacMan moving across the page while opening and closing his mouth a 2D array was created. In the pacArray index[0][0] and [0][1] contains the opened and closed mouth images for pacMan moving to the left while index [1][0] and [1][1] contain the images for PacMan going to the left. Function Run was created with a setInterval so pacMac will move automatically on the page. Lastly, function checkPageBounds was created for the purpose of edge dections utilizing if conditional statments to reverse the current direction.  
## Installation 
Drag and drop PacMan.Html onto a blank webpage and load the page. You should see PacMan running back and fourth on the page.
## Usage
This project is good example of edge dection and alternating images using a 2D array.
## Support

## Roadmap
The future outcome from this project is to add a ghost on the screen that stays ahead of pacMan.
